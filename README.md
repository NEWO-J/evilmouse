The code for my evilmouse project - HID Keystroke injection for the RP2040-Zero designed to send a PowerShell reverse shell to a target host with Administrator privileges - Fully bypasses Windows Defender

This tool was built for **ethical** hacking purposes only. I am not resposnible for misusage of this tool.

## Make your own evilmouse

- Hold down the BOOT button on your RP2040-zero and plug it in.
- Once you see the RPI-RP2 drive, drag the `adafruit-circuitpython-waveshare_rp2040_zero-en_US-8.2.8.uf2` file into it.
- The drive should then be flashed as CIRCUITPYTHON
- Drag all the files in src to your RP2040-ZERO drive.
- OPTIONAL: Put it inside a disguise of choice, plug it in and watch the magic happen :)
